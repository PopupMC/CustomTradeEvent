## Custom Trade event

I often like to add random blocks and stuff to villager trades but it's no good
to roll for that on every plugin (Thus overshadowing normal villager trades).
This allows to roll once for villager trades and then roll individually only
if this master roll succeeds.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
